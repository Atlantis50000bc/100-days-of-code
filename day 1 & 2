Yesterday I started my first oficial day of 100-days-of-code/.
My first "professional" time on twitter and of course my first tweet with fellow programmars at 100-days-of-code.

My programming yesterday constituted of:

Multiply Two Decimals with JavaScript Complete

Divide one Decimal by Another with JavaScript Complete

Finding a Remainder in JavaScript Complete

Compound Assignment With Augmented Addition Complete

Compound Assignment With Augmented Subtraction Complete

Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication Complete

Compound Assignment With Augmented Division Complete

Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit

I allready finished HTML5 & CSS - RESPONSIVE DESIGN WITH BOOTSTRAP - JQUERY (PARTIALY) the reason for this is that I was demotivated and wanted to start with with real programming.
I must say I still have to do the BASIC FRONT END DEVELLOPMENT PROJECT but as I said i wanted to start programming before I lost all motivation.
end.
